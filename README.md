# C++ Investigation Project

This C++ project is a university student registration system. It reads student data from a file, processes it, and writes the processed data to another file. The data includes student names, IDs, registration status, level, and credits. The user is prompted to input the institution's name, campus, and professor's name. The processed data, including the institution's name, campus, department, semester, professor's name, course, and the table of students' information, is then written to a new file named "output.csv".

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

This project requires MinGW to compile and run. The minimum version requirement is MinGW 3.6.0-1 from 2019, but the recommended version is MinGW w64 version 11.0 or 12.0. The code has been tested in MinGW 3.6.0-1, MinGW w64 11.0 and 12.0.

### MinGW Installation

1. Download the MinGW Installation Manager from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

2. Open the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install MinGW Installation Manager.

3. Once installed, open the MinGW Installation Manager.

4. Select the packages you need (at least `mingw32-base` and `mingw32-gcc-g++`).

5. Apply changes and wait for the packages to be installed.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This version of MinGW is outdated. Use at your own risk.

For a visual guide on installing MinGW, you can watch this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzOmcmUcl_E).

### MinGW w64 Installation

1. Download MSYS2 from the [official page](https://www.msys2.org/) or directly via this [installer link](https://www.msys2.org/).

2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Choose your installation folder (the default is usually fine) and ensure to check `Run MSYS2 now` at the end.

3. Once installed, open MSYS2 terminal.

4. In the MSYS2 terminal, execute: `pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain`

5. Type `Y` and press Enter when prompted to confirm the installation.

### MinGW Environment Variable Set-up

1. Open the System Properties (Right click Computer in the start menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Win+Pause)

2. Click Advanced system settings

3. Click Environment Variables

4. Under System Variables, find and select the Path variable

5. Click Edit

6. In the Edit System Variable window, click New

7. Type the path to the MinGW bin folder (e.g., `C:\MinGW\bin` or `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` for MinGW w64)

8. Click OK in all windows to apply the changes

You may need to restart any open command prompt windows for changes to take effect.

### Testing Installation

After installing MinGW or MinGW w64, you can test whether the installation was successful by running the following commands in the command prompt:

```cmd
gcc --version
g++ --version
gdb --version
```
## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHow to Run

To run the code, you need to have MinGW installed with a release higher than `6.3.0-1` from 2019. The code also works with current iterations of MinGW (MinGW-w64 such as 11.0 w64 the latest version of MSYS2 12.0 w64).

### Running in jGrasp

1. **Set up the workspace**: Install and open jGrasp. Navigate to `Settings > PATH/CLASSPATH > Workspace`. From the Workspace, select the `PATH` tab, then select the `PATHS` tab. Click on `New` and insert the path of your MinGW directory (For MSYS2, it's `C:\msys64\ucrt64`. For MinGW 6.3.0-1 it's `C:\MinGW`).

2. **Set the compiler**: Go to the `Compiler` tab, set the language to `C++`, and in the `Environment` tab, select `g++ generic`. Click `Apply` then `Close`.

3. **Run the code**: In the `Browse` tab on the left side of jGrasp, navigate to the path of the project folder and open `main.cpp`. Click on the double green `+` icon in the header to compile and link the codes, then click on the red running icon to run the `main.exe` executable file.

### Running in Visual Studio Code

1. **Install Visual Studio Code and MinGW**: If you haven't already, install Visual Studio Code and MinGW. Make sure to add MinGW to your system's PATH.

2. **Install the C++ extension**: Go to the Extensions view (`View > Extensions`), search for `c++`, and then install the `C/C++` extension provided by Microsoft.

3. **Open the project in Visual Studio Code**: Open Visual Studio Code, then go to `File > Open Folder` and select the project folder.

4. **Run the code**: Click `Run or Debug...` on the top right corner, click Run and select `C/C++: g++ from C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\g++.exe` to build the code. This will create an executable file in the same directory as your source code as well as run it (might have to run it 2 times).

## üîßUsage

## How to Use

This program is designed to process student data from a text file and output it in a CSV format. Here are the steps to use this program:

1. **Compile and Run the Program**: To start the program, you have two options based on your development environment:

   - If using a command-line interface (CLI), first compile the `main.cpp` file and then run the resulting executable with the following commands:

     Example:
     ```bash
     g++ main.cpp -o main
     ./main
     ```

   - Alternatively, if using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like jGrasp, simply click on the **Compile and Link** button, then the **Run** button.


2. **Input File Path**: The program will first ask you to enter the path of the input text file. This file should contain the student data that you want to process. You can enter just the file name if the file is in the same directory as the program, or the full path to the file. If the file has a `.txt` extension, you can include it, but if you don't, the program will automatically add it for you.

   Example:
   ```
   Ingresa la ruta del archivo: ./Resources/Data/student_data.txt
   ```

3. **Enter Additional Information**: The program will then ask you to enter additional information that is not included in the input file. This includes the name of the institution, the campus, the department, and the professor's name. Please enter these details as prompted.

   Example:
   ```
   Nombre de Institucion: Interamrican University of Puerto Rico
   Recinto: Main Campus
   Departamento: Department of Computer Science
   Profesor: John Doe
   ```

4. **Output File Path**: Finally, the program will ask you to enter the path and name of the output CSV file. This is where the processed data will be written. As with the input file, you can enter just the file name if you want the file to be created in the same directory as the program, or the full path to the file. If the file has a `.csv` extension, you can include it, but if you don't, the program will automatically add it for you.

   Example:
   ```
   Ingresa la ruta y nombre del archivo de salida: ../Resources/Output/student_output.csv
   ```

5. **Check the Output**: Once you've entered all the required information, the program will process the data and write it to the output file. It will then print a message telling you that the data has been exported. You can now open the output file to see the processed data.

   Example:
   ```
   Los datos se han exportado al archivo ../Resources/Output/student_output.csv
   ```

Please note that this program assumes that the input file is formatted correctly and that all the data is valid. If the program encounters an error while reading the file, it will print an error message and terminate.
